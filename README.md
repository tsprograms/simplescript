# SimpleScript
SimpleScript is a simple yet beautiful all-purpose programming language. This JavaScript runtime is lightweight (very few lines of code) and portable.

Check out the REPL [here](http://tsprograms.github.io/simplescript/ "The SimpleScript REPL")!

Please note that SimpleScript is a work-in-progress. There are **many** bugs and TODOs that are not yet resolved.
